# article-sharing-website
An article sharing website developed by Go.

~~Here is a live demo: [inews](https://www.inewsforpharm.com/) (hosting on AWS EC2 with Load Balancer, Route 53, SES, Certificate Manager.)~~
The website has been closed due to the cost of maintenance being too high. See the **Demo** section at the end of the README.

## Overview
I choose [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) as the backend web framework for its simplicity and high performance (it is also the most popular framework in Go, see [Top Go Web Frameworks](https://github.com/mingrammer/go-web-framework-stars)).

For database ORM, I choose [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm). It is a full-featured ORM with great community support and [easy to follow documentation](https://gorm.io/docs/).
Besides, if you choose `sqlite` as the database driver, then you can get rid of the setting database burden (the data will be stored in a file `tmp.db` in the root of project) and focus on the backend development.

The admin users are created by the following mechanism:
1. Write down their emails in `config.yml`
2. Setup web server
3. Register with these corresponding emails on the website

If you are a novice to the database with no idea about the **many-to-many relationship**, the `databases/bookmark.go` is a good example. I utilize many-to-many relationship to implement features such as searching articles with tags and bookmarking articles.

## Setup
The credentials are stored in `config.yml`. There are some environment variables that can be overwritten (inside `config/config.go`). Environment variables have a `WEB_` prefix. You might want to use some of them: `WEB_APP_HTTP_PORT`, `WEB_APP_HTTPS_PORT`, `WEB_DB_PORT`, and `WEB_DB_HOST`.

To send reset password emails, see the **Others** section.

#### Local
```bash
# Set the env values if needed
# export WEB_APP_HTTP_PORT=8080
# export WEB_APP_HTTPS_PORT=8443
# export WEB_DB_PORT=3306
# export WEB_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
go run cmd/main.go
```

#### Docker
1. Build
* Development
```bash
docker build . --target builder -t cwhuang29/article-sharing-website:dev
```
* Production
```bash
docker build . -t cwhuang29/article-sharing-website:prod
```

2. Run
* Database
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name db \
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=inews \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=a1234567 \
    -e MYSQL_USER=user01 \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=a1234567 \
    mysql:5.7.32 \
    mysqld --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci
```
* Web server
```bash
docker run -d \
    --name web \
    --link db:db \
    -e WEB_APP_HTTP_PORT=80 \
    -e WEB_APP_HTTPS_PORT=443 \
    -e WEB_DB_PORT=3306 \
    -e WEB_DB_HOST=db \
    -e WEB_APP_URL=https://example.com \
    -e WEB_EMAIL_SENDER=<sender email address> \
    -e WEB_EMAIL_REGION=us-east-1
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    cwhuang29/article-sharing-website:prod
```

## Others
#### Sending emails via AWS SES
1. Fill in settings in the `email` section in `config.yml`. Sender email address and region can be overwritten by env `WEB_EMAIL_SENDER` and `WEB_EMAIL_REGION` respectively.
2. `app.url` is mandatory cause the reset password link is based on this value (can be overwritten by`WEB_APP_URL`)
3. `email.numPerDay` and `email.numPerSec` in `config.yml`, which represent maximum send quota/rate, is the restrictions imposed by AWS.
4. AWS retrieves credentials under `~/.aws/credentials`.  Copy credentials from the AWS web console and create this file with the following content:
```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```
5. Verify domains and (sender) email addresses on AWS console (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html)).
6. Submit a request to AWS to increase sending limits and move your account out of the Amazon SES sandbox (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/manage-sending-quotas.html)).

#### Connect to database
Instead of connecting to the database container (which name is `db` in my case) directly, we can run another MySQL container and query the database container.
```
docker run -it --rm --link db:db mysql:5.7.32 mysql -hdb -u user01 -pa1234567 inews
```

#### Dump database
To dump the database, run
```bash
docker exec -it db mysqldump -u user01 -pa1234567 inews > data-`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`.sql
```

There is some warning messages while dumping out data. To avoid warning, you can run:
```
docker exec -it db mysqldump -u user01 -pa1234567 --no-tablespaces inews <tables, seperated by space> \
    grep -v "Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure" > data-`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`.sql
```

#### SSL/TLS Certificates
Since all cookies are sent only with encrypted requests and responses, you may want to get certificates for localhost. Here is a good example: [How to get HTTPS working on your local development environment in 5 minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-https-working-on-your-local-development-environment-in-5-minutes-7af615770eec/).
After setting up the certificates, copy `server.crt` and `server.key` to the `certs/` folder (in the root of the project), and then connect to URL `https://localhost`.

#### Install environment on AWS
If you want to host the website on AWS EC2, run the following script to install Docker and MySQL
Do note that installing docker takes about 1.5~2 GB space. You might want to create an EC2 with a larger disk space
```bash
# Install Docker
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
# Logout and log back in

# Install MySQL
sudo yum -y install mysql
```
